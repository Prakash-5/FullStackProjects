This project is dedicated to the TimesPro learning platform which I have chosen to get my Full Stack Development certificate from.

The website is a Portfolio made for an E-Learning Platform which consists of static HTML and CSS.
The users can go through the brochure and find all the information regarding the Learning platform,
They can comment below the experience and also view ratings from the alumnii to know more about the particular platform.
Also any person can subscribr to the news letter offered by the Institution for future needs.

Please find the images below to check out the UI of the project and comment down the best part!! Thank you.
