This project is a combination of a Piano player cum Music player.

It has 2 different web pages which are connected through hyper links for better navigation between each other.
The modules go as follows:

Piano Player:
- It requires access to the physical or virtual keyboard for PC users and also has touch support for mobile users.
- When a certain key is clicked, then the program goes into the local database created for audio tunes and then check if that key is assigned to any of the tune.
- The naming convention for tunes is so basic so any user can easily understand the use case of the web application.
- Now when the tune is played, I've added the feature where you can superpose various tunes by multiple inputs giving the end user millions of ways to create music according to their taste.


Music Player:
- It has all the key features included as compared to any premium music library app available at recent times.
- The user gets to choose the different songs he wants to play and also go seek just to listen to his favourite drop of the beats any time.
- The end user's satisfaction is fulfilled when he can create oen playlist and play the songs according to his convenience and mood
  by switching betwwen the songs, repeat playing a particular song and also you can shuffle the playlist if that's what he needs.
